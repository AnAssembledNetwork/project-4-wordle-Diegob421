# project-4-wordle-Diegob421
This was my final project and in this project the program generated a random 5 letter word and you would have to try to guess the correct word. Each time you guess
the program would print out a keyboard and highlight words in either green, yellow, or red. If you did not guess the word in 6 guess then you would lose, otherwise
you would win.
